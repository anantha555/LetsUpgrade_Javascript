    <h1>Question 7</h1>
    <p> 
        An integer number greater than 1 is called a prime if it cannot be divided without a remainder by anything
        except 1 and itself. <br><br>
        In other words, n > 1 is a prime if it canâ€™t be evenly divided by anything except 1 and n. <br><br>
        For example, 5 is a prime, because it cannot be divided without a remainder by 2, 3 and 4. <br><br>
        Write the code which outputs prime numbers in the interval from 2 to n. <br><br>
        For n = 10 the result will be 2,3,5,7. <br><br>
        P.S. The code should work for any n, not be hard-tuned for any fixed value <br><br>
    </p>

            for(let j = 2; j <= i - 1; j++) 
                if (i % j == 0) { 
                    flag = false; 
                    break;
