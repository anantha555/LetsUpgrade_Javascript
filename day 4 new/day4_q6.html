    <h1>Question 6</h1>
    <p> 
        Rewrite the function using '?' or '||' <br> <br>
        Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the visitor enters another number – ask them
        to input again. <br> <br>
        The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a number greater than 100 or cancels the
        input/enters an empty line. <br> <br>
        Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no need to implement a special
        handling for a non-numeric input in this task.
        
    </p>
    <script>
        let num = +prompt('Enter a number greater than 100:');
        while(num <= 100 && num != 0 && num != null){
            console.log(`Asking user to try again, as the user entered ${num} which is not greater than 100.`);
            num = prompt('Try again! Number above 100 only!');
        }
