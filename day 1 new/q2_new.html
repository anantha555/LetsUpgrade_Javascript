<!-- Question 2 :
Write the difference between var, let and const with code examples. -->

<!-- 
1. var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped; 
   let and const are block scoped;
2. var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; 
   let variables can be updated but not re-declared; 
   const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared;
3. They are all hoisted to the top of their scope;
   But while var variables are initialized with undefined;
   let and const variables are not initialized;
4. var and let can be declared without being initialized;
   const must be initialized during declaration;
